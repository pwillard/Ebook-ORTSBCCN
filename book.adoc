== About This Document

This is a first attempt at a guide to using Blender with Open Rails for content creation.   For this document, the Long Term Support (LTS) version of Blender 2.8 will be used. Older versions of Blender will not be referenced or used.



=== About The Author

I am not an expert.  I can best be described as a curious user and occasional content creator. I've been an eternal novice with regards to content creation in general and there are going to be things that I still don't understand sufficiently.

From 2002 until 2016, all of my 3rd party content releases have been for Microsoft Train Simulator using 3DCanvas (Ultimately renamed to 3D Crafter)

Initially, I started with versions of Blender released before version 2.8 and it didn't seem to me to be very user-friendly. Due to the foereign and combersome nature of early Blender versions, I also didn't get very far with it.  When version 2.8 arrived, it was still hard to get started but it was a vast improvement.  Now, after seeing some of the basic modeling techniques available in Blender, I don’t think I will switch to a different 3D modeling tool anytime soon.

== Preface

Here is the list of things that I assume about the reader.

* You are new to Blender
* You are reasonably new to content creation for Open Rails
* You have Open Rails installed and working
* You have installed TSRE5 for Consist management
* You have a texture file editor that supports PSD, PNG and DDS formats.footnote:[A good example is the Paint.net, or GIMP which are both free] 
* You have some idea about how Open Rails (and MSTS) content is created
* You have a project in mind, but you understand that you will not create your Magnum Opus on a first try.

If you have prior experience with GMAX, Train Sim Modeler or 3D Canvas, it will be a plus, but it is not required.


=== Organization of This Document

As the title implies, this document is based on a collection notes I made while learning to make content for {OR}.  As a result, it may not be the most organized or useful document on the subjects discussed within it but it is primarily aimed at filling a void in the documentation set for {OR}.  This document is FREE and Open Source.  It will ultimately live on in the GITHUB repository.  This means that others are welcome to fork a copy, edit it to add sections or fix errors if desired.  The author does not claim unrealistic ownership of the ideas and concepts contained within.

Due to the way this document originated, it may seem to jump around and be repetetive at times. My apologies in advance if this bothers you but if you are so inspired, you are welcome to help fixing any errors, problems or omissions.
