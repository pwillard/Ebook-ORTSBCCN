== BACKGROUND 
=== The {font} lettering font

// NOTE: The FONT needs to be assigned in the proper YAML file and a copy needs to exist
//       in the FONTS folder.

[NOTE]
This is a free font and cannot be sold or be part of a commercial product.

This font was created using references from the Internet. It is based on various sources related to Google searches.

Most of the reference materials are from RailRoad Picture Archives http://www.rrpicturearchives.net

This lettering started as a request from Dave Edwards at http://www.Trainsim.com who wanted a better Straley Logo that allowed for a 2-color option.
I had a few ideas for additional tank cars (such as various additional kaolin seen moving around the Southeast.  When I was working at the Scott Paper plant in Mobile, Kaolin cars were dumping slurry quite often.)

Changes: Version 1.1 adds the ` key to create the modern "ACF" logo.

=== Disclaimer
This ttf font is a best effort attempt at recreating a vector based image suite related to {comp}.  Some variances exist in real life and therefore there may be some discrepancies between what is supplied here and actual prototype references.

== Font Usage 
=== Installation
The file is distributed as part of a ZIP file that includes this document as well as the font itself and other related documentation.

The files need to be UNZIPPED from the distribution file into a temporary work area, like `C:\TEMP`. (I’ll assume that you used `c:\temp` from here on…) 

You can often just double-click the TTF file and the system will provide an install option.

Now you can install the font from the Windows `CONTROL PANEL`.  

Your system may be different, but for Windows 7, you would select START {arrow} Settings {arrow} Control Panel {arrow} FONTS {arrow} FILE [pull down] {arrow} INSTALL NEW FONT

From here you would select your new file `C:\temp\`*{font}*

That’s it, the font is installed.

As with all other TTF fonts on your system, the {font} file enclosed within the ZIP file belongs in the FONTS folder of your windows operating system.  This is the only way this file would be useful.

== Special instructions

Some symbols require multiple colors and of course fonts are single color.  This means that some shapes are broken up into multiple symbols to allow for additional colors to be added to create he final result.

For the 2 color Staley, for example, the stand-alone S shapes are vertical and horizontal and it is up to you to carefully align the two differenty color shapes to get the correct result.

Additionally, for the Hooker Logo, you need to add a black shadow using the shapes provided, then cover them with a white color of the shapes to create the shadow effect.

For the Williams logo, add a WHITE background using the "<" key and then change the font color to blue and align the blue outline with the ">" key.

The Gulf Logo's are also multi-pass if you are aiming for a full color logo but you should be able to figure it out.

For ADM, its up to you to fill in the blue in the "ADM" letters after placing the WHITE outline.
